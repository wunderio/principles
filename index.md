## We are Wunder

These are the values that make us who we are. They push us to be better and to achieve our goals.

## We are Open

We push openness and transparency to new extremes. Everything we create is open by default. We are highly collaborative and work easily and often with others, including our clients, open source communities, and other firms in our industry. We share our knowledge and experience widely. We're great listeners, curious and always open to ideas and feedback. We communicate clearly and often.

What if all three agencies involved together and share the budget equally and manage the work together?</p><p>It was a bold move and it worked out well. All team members were treated equally regardless of company. It also kept our code quality high, we knew that our competition would be reviewing our code, we wouldn't want to take shortcuts or leave technical debt.</p>" %}

## We are Professional

We work hard to build and maintain trust with our clients. We're always learning from others and from experimentation, bringing credible expertise to our work. We support each other as a team. We can always be relied on to deliver. We're respected for the ways in which we work.

## We are Healthy

We favour long-term sustainable success over short term benefits. We do what's right for our clients and what's right for each other. We value diversity, individuality and weirdness. We have fun, are happy, and bring fun and happiness to others too. We support each other. We have a healthy attitude to failure, facing up to it, learning from our mistakes and avoiding blame. We work in healthy ways, to support a high quality of life. We value being a healthy sustainable company.

## We are Fluid

We are flexible and adaptable in the way we work, the way we learn, the way we think, and the way we are structured. We encourage and accept change. We're agile in the way we deliver. We work in borderless ways — as one team in the company, and one team with client organisations.

## We are Leaders

We lead as an organisation, with clients and communities valuing and adopting our ideas and practices. We lead as individuals, operating as a do-ocracy where any team member can step up to lead on initiatives and projects, in the company and in our communities. Our leadership style is consultative but decisive, with a bias for action. We aim to inspire and enthuse, and lead by example.

I shared our template contract with them.</p><p>Another UK Drupal agency was having problems. I met them for an afternoon to help them work them out. Although they manifested as financial problems, at root they were problems created in the sales and project delivery processes. I shared our processes with them, and they are now more successful.</p>" %}
